                                    ReactNative
                                ===================

===>  when we talking about ReactJs we are talking about web applications.

===>  the web applications browser based applications.

===> smart TV , computer

===> when we talking about ReactNative we are talking about native applications like

===> Android and IOS applications

===> the applications can be mobile, tablet etc.....

===> A native application is a software program that is developed to be used on particular platform or device.

===> the device make use of two types of OS platform Apple's IOS and google's Android.

===> native apps can provide optimized performance and take advantage of the latest technology, such as GPS.

===> they also have access to phone's various devices, such as its camera and address book. in addition, users 

      can have some applications with out internet.

===> it provides fast performance and high degree of reliability.


ReactNative:
=============

===> ReactNative is a technology that allows us to build real native applications with the help of Javascript

    and react libraries which we can ship to either app store or google play store.

===> ReactNative provides you a collection of special components. the components are compiled to native

     widgets of IOS and Android.

===> it provides you can access to native platform of API's 

        example : device camera.

===> it provides certain tools to connect Javascript code to native platform code.

===> ReactNative features are combined with ReactJs to compile a Javascript code to a Real Native application

     which can be later shifted to app store play store.

===> generally Android application are developed using java and ios applications using shift.

===> here instead of HTML elements you will be writing your application code using native elements like

      view and text.

            example:

                  const App =()=>{
                    return{
                        <view>
                           <text>
                                welcome to the ReactNative class
                           </text>
                        </view>
                    }
                  }

Expo CLI:
=========
===> expo cli is a command line app that is the main interface between a developer and expo tools.

===> it is used for variety tasks, such as

===> creating new project

===> developing your app (Running the project server, view logs, opening your app in a simulator)

===> publishing your app, Javascript and other assets plus manage their release.

===> building binaries (apk and ipa files) to be uploaded to the app store and play store.

===> Managing Apple credentials and Google key store.

     command : sudo npm i -g expo-cli

===> to create project :  npx create-expo-app <projectName> && cd <projectName>
